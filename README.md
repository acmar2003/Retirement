# Retirement Model

This Retirement Model helps you understand how far your money will take you into retirement based on historical data.

## Overview

The current state of the model demonstrates holding all assets in an S&P 500 index fund. The `$^SPX` is used as it has more extensive historical data than `$VOO` or other ETFs. You can choose any range of time throughout history and any capital gains tax bracket. This model allows you to apply these parameters to the amount of capital you invested and currently have, showing how much money you could spend per year and how it would affect your overall asset base.

## Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Utilize historical data from the S&P 500 index to project retirement funds.
- **Customizable Time Range**: Select any range of time throughout history for analysis.
- **Capital Gains Tax Bracket**: Choose any capital gains tax bracket to apply to your investments.
- **Investment Simulation**: Apply the model to your invested capital to see potential yearly spending and asset performance.
- **Visual Representation**: Charts at the bottom represent how your money would perform relative to the S&P 500, with red lines indicating when sales take place.

## Usage

1. **Select Time Range**: Choose the historical time range for analysis.
2. **Set Capital Gains Tax Bracket**: Select the appropriate capital gains tax bracket.
3. **Input Capital**: Enter the amount of capital you have invested and currently hold.
4. **Run Simulation**: The model will show how much money you could spend per year and the impact on your overall asset base.
5. **Review Charts**: Analyze the charts to see the performance of your money relative to the S&P 500, with sales indicated by red lines.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the model:

1. Input the total amount of capital invested ($1,000,000).
2. Input the current value of assets (cash and securities) ($7,000,000).
3. Set the capital gains tax bracket to 20% (0.2).
4. Set the start year and amount of years held (1994, 30).
5. Optional: input a ticker symbol for etf or stock (easiest to use an index as there is more historical data).
6. Run the simulation to see performance of asset base and cash available for yearly expenses.

## Charts

The charts at the bottom of the model provide a visual representation of your money's performance relative to the S&P 500. The red lines indicate when sales take place for reference.
